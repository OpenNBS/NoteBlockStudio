## üìÑ Project Status

The current version is considered stable and feature-complete; as such, it's no longer accepting contributions or new features other than minor bug fixes.

In order to future-proof the project and allow us to make further improvements, we're currently in the process of rewriting the program using the Qt framework. You can read more about this and our future plans regarding the project in [this discussion](https://github.com/OpenNBS/OpenNoteBlockStudio/discussions/426)!

## üë• Contributing

This project is written in the GameMaker Language (GML). You must have [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/) in order to open the project and make changes.

Since OpenNBS relies on 32-bit DLLs, you must use the GameMaker runtime version **2022.6** as 32-bit support was removed in further versions. Scroll down [this page](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html) and click _'Older versions'_ to find the appropriate installer.
