Changes in v3.11.0 (2024.12.14):


Additions:

* Added a button on the greeting window to open Note Block World, our brand
   new website for browsing and sharing note block songs!

* Added a sound import assistant to help you use sounds from Minecraft: Java
   Edition in your songs!
    * Accessible from Settings > Import sounds from Minecraft.
    * Make sure to launch the version you want from the Launcher before
   importing its sounds. Set your Minecraft installation path and game version,
   click the button to get sounds and watch them get imported automagically!
    * The sounds from the selected version will be copied to the 'minecraft'
   folder in your Sounds folder.

* It is now possible to save a song with its custom sound files attached.
    * Reach over to File > Save song with instruments... to find this option.
    * This makes sharing songs with custom instruments easier than ever!
    * The saved file is a regular ZIP file containing the song, as well as the
   sound files used in it.
    * This feature replaces the 'Export sounds' option, previously accessible
   from the Instruments window.

* The behavior for clicking layer buttons has been changed:
    * You can now click and drag over consecutive buttons to trigger them
   without needing to click each one.
    * This should make it much easier to add, remove, select, lock and solo
   multiple layers!
    * Selected layers can now be deselected by pressing the 'Select all blocks
   in this layer' button a second time.
    * Holding Ctrl is no longer necessary to select multiple layers.

* The fade in and fade out macros now work relatively to each note's velocity,
   multiplying it by the decay factor.
    * Previously, only the first note block in each selected column would be
   taken into account for determining all velocity values in that column.
    * Notes at each end of the selection will no longer go down to velocity 0,
   or into negative values.

* Added Minecraft version setting to data pack export.
    * You can choose between 1.13-1.20 and 1.21+.
    * This was necessary due to a change in the internal structure of data
   packs, in order to not break compatibility with older versions.

* Added a new auto-recovery system which takes multiple open instances into
   account:
    * Songs with unsaved changes are saved to a backup directory every minute.
    * When NBS quits abnormally (due to a crash, power loss or system restart),
   you'll be prompted to recover the files the next time you open the program.
    * Clicking 'Yes' will copy the files to a restore directory so you can move
   them somewhere else.
    * Clicking 'No' will leave the unsaved files in the backup directory so you
   can recover them later.
    * You can also open the backup directory by going to File > 'Restore
   unsaved files'.
    * This mechanic is experimental, so make sure to leave your feedback so we
   can improve it further!

* Note Block Studio now registers itself as a handler for the `nbs://` URL
   protocol on startup.
    * This can be used to download and open NBS files directly from an external
   application, such as a blog or website.
    * By default, the program will launch in the player mode when handling the
   protocol.
    * To prevent security risks, the file won't be opened if it can't be
   detected as a valid song, or if it's over a certain size.

* Added a 'Loop end tick' option in the song properties.
   * Setting it to a tick greater than the song length will add a silent note
   at that tick to move the loop end point further.

* Removed the 'Loop to bar end' option from Preferences.
   * This option was misleading in that it 'masked' the true loop point of the
   song, which is after the last tick * causing playback behavior to vary across
   different NBS installations.
   * To make sure your songs loop at the right point, change the 'Loop end
   tick' in the song properties, or manually add a note block with velocity 0 at
   the last tick before the intended looping point.
   * This setting may be re-added in the future as a property stored in each
   song file.

* Blackout mode is now available in Player Mode, including the shortcut (F10)!

* If present, the song author and original author are now displayed in the
   Player Mode's main view.

* Added new OpenNBS social links to the greeting window, the Help menu and the
   About window.

* Added donation links! If NBS is useful to you and you'd like to support its
   development, feel free to check out this option in the greeting window or the
   Help menu.

* Added a small banner to the greeting window which lets you buy us a coffee
   via our Open Collective. Thank you!



Bugfixes and improvements:

   folder, causing them to reappear on subsequent exports.

* Fixed the demo songs using wrong custom instrument paths.
* Silent notes have been added at the end of the demo songs to make sure they
   loop at the proper point.

   which should prevent certain softlock cases.

   arrangements.

   adding a new layer.

   GameMaker.
* Removed the button to watch tutorial videos from the greeting window.
* Lag compensation is now cancelled if too much time has elapsed (for example,
   when moving the window around). Playback will resume from the previous point
   instead of skipping a large section.
* Lag compensation is now applied to more internal timers, which should be more
   accurate to wall-clock time:
   * Auto-save and backup saving timers;

   * Time tracker for minutes spent in a song;
   * Scrollbar appear animation for fullscreen mode.
* Ticks behind the playback marker will no longer play when dragging it around.
