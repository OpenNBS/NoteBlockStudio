Changes in v3.11.0 Release Candidate 1 (2024.12.04):

Additions

* Added a 'Loop end tick' option in the song properties.
   * Setting it to a tick greater than the song length will add a silent note at that
   tick to move the loop point further.

* The MIDI import instrument mappings have been tweaked to be more accurate
   to General MIDI (GM) instruments.

Bugfixes and improvements:

* Fixed layer buttons triggering inconsistently when dragging from bottom to top.
* Fixed window animations not working after opening the 'Import sounds' window.
* Fixed uninstall function of exported data packs not loading correctly.
* Updated the NBS icon to a flat version. The previous icon can still be used with
   the 'Old icon' setting.
* Changed all instances of 'Minecraft Note Block Studio' and 'Open Note Block
   Studio' to Note Block Studio, as part of an ongoing rebrand.
* Replaced the icon for the 'Browse songs' button in the greeting window with
   the Note Block World website icon.
* Improved wording across various places.



Changes in v3.11.0 Beta 5 (2024.12.02):

Additions:

* The behavior for clicking layer buttons has been changed:
   * Multiple buttons can now be pressed consecutively by holding the left mouse
   button and dragging the mouse over them.
   * This should make it much easier to add, remove, select, lock and solo multiple
   layers!

* Holding Ctrl is no longer necessary to select multiple layers.

* Selected layers can now be deselected by pressing the 'Select all blocks in this
   layer' button a second time.

* Removed the 'Loop to bar end' option.
   * This option was misleading in that it 'masked' the true loop point of the song,
   which is after the last tick, causing playback behavior to vary across different
   NBS installations.
   * To make sure your songs loop at the right point, add a note block with velocity
   0 at the last tick before the looping point.
   * This setting may be re-added in the future as a property stored in each song file.

* Added an entry in the File menu for restoring unsaved files.

* If present, song author and original author are now displayed in the main view
   for the Player Mode.

Bugfixes and improvements:

* Fixed songs not loading when opened via Explorer or by dragging and dropping.
* Fixed backup file for packed songs being saved with the .zip extension, despite
   them being .nbs files.
* Lag compensation is now cancelled if too much time has elapsed (for example,
   when moving the window around). Playback will resume from the previous
   point instead of skipping a large section.
* Lag compensation is now applied to more timers, which should be more
    accurate:
   * Auto-save and backup saving timers;
   * Flash animation when editing piano keyboard shortcuts;
   * Time tracker for minutes spent in a song;
   * Scrollbar appear animation for fullscreen mode.
* Ticks behind the playback marker will no longer play when dragging it around.
* Silent notes have been added at the end of the demo songs to make sure they
   loop at the proper point.
* Songs opened via the nbs:// URL protocol have the file extension removed from
   their display name.
* Fixed pointer cursor not appearing when hovering keys at the edges of the
   piano in Player Mode.
* Fixed the Player Mode playback progress bar going past its intended length at
   the end of a song.
* Fixed blurry appearance of the Player Mode's central area with odd window
   dimensions.
* Fixed dropdown menu for MIDI devices not displaying text properly in the
   English language.
* Fixed incorrect entries for the bass drum sounds in the sounds.json file for the
   extra notes resource pack.
* Fixed the Stereo macro being referred to as 'delay' in the tooltip for the
   'Reversed' checkbox.
* Fixed a crash when playing an instrument that was assigned to a MIDI device.
* Fixed swapped arrows for the instrument selection box when using
   high-resolution textures.
* Fixed original author not displaying in the accent color in the song stats window
   when using the Fluent theme.
* Added a debug launch option to get additional logs for bug reporting.
* Updated the asset index version names for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.2 and
   1.21.4 (18 and 19).
* Removed the 'experimental' label from the max. frame rate setting.

Hidden changes:

* Tempo can no longer be set to under 0.25 ticks per second with tempo changers.
* Added tempo change indicators to the timeline.



Changes in v3.11.0 Beta 4 (2024.11.28):

* Fixed note panning taking the value of velocity when loading a song.
* The 'Check for development releases' is now enabled by default when installing
   a development release.



Changes in v3.11.0 Beta 3 (2024.11.28):

Additions:

* Added a new auto-recovery system which takes multiple open instances into
   account:
   * Songs with unsaved changes are saved to a backup directory every 10 minutes.
   * When NBS quits abnormally (due to a crash, power loss or system restart),
   you'll be prompted to recover the files the next time you open the program.
   * Clicking 'Yes' will copy the files to a restore directory so you can move them
   somewhere else.
   * Clicking 'No' will leave the unsaved files in the backup directory so you can
   recover them later.

* The fade in and fade out macros now work relatively to each note's velocity,
   multiplying it by the decay factor.
   * Previously, only the first note block in each selected column would be taken
   into account for determining all velocity values in that column.
   * Notes at each end of the selection will no longer go down to velocity 0, or
   into negative values.

* Blackout mode is now available in Player Mode, including the shortcut (F10)!

* Added a button to the greeting window to open Note Block World, our brand
   new website for browsing and sharing note block songs!

Bugfixes and improvements:

* The link for the OpenNBS QQ group will be displayed instead of Discord when
   the language is set to Chinese.
* Added a small banner to the greeting window which lets you buy us a coffee.
   Thank you!
* Macro windows are now closed immediately if no note blocks are selected,
   which should prevent certain softlock cases.
* Fixed auto-save ticking down into negative values and saving the song every
   frame once the timer reaches zero.
* Fixed opening songs with the nbs:// URL protocol not working in some cases.
* Fixed a crash when compressing a selection with some particular note
   arrangements.
* Loading and saving songs have been made much faster.
* Fixed the application name in Task Manager, Programs and Resources etc.
   being incorrectly set to a description.
* Fixed solo button states not moving together with the layers when adding a
   new layer above a solo layer.
* Fixed the volume slider number popup going past the intended range.
* Transparency effects are now disabled if setting them up failed in the last
   session.
* Fixed the piano keybind flashing faster while being edited according to your
   FPS setting.
* Reduced the maximum channel count with 'Use more audio channels' enabled
   from 32,768 to 1,024, the largest possible value.
* Removed the button to watch tutorial videos from the greeting window.
* Fixed offset of vertical bars (|) in the greeting window links while using the
   classic themes due to their wider font.
* Replaced the opennbs.org url with noteblock.studio.
* Updated credits in the About window.
